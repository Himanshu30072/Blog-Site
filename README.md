Blog Application with REST APIs

This project is a complete Blog Application built using Spring Boot. It demonstrates how to create a robust, secure, and scalable RESTful API for managing blog posts and user interactions. The application also incorporates modern best practices in API development, security, and deployment.

Features

REST API Design Principles:

Resource & sub-resource modeling.

Proper usage of HTTP methods and status codes.


Validation & Exception Handling:

Input validation for API requests.

Global and custom exception handling.


Entity Relationships:

JPA mappings such as one-to-many and many-to-many.


DTO Pattern: Use of Data Transfer Objects to separate API responses from domain models.

Transaction Management: Ensures data consistency with Spring Data JPA.

API Documentation: Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI with customization.

Environment Profiles: Support for different environments (development, production).
